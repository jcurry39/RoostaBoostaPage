# RoostaBoosta

Who doesn't need a good morning boost?
Return to your rich idyllic pastoral roots with RoostaBoostaâ„¢, the innovative, awesome, groundbreaking, fascinating, mind-boggling, stupendous IoT weather-predicting alarm clock!

Final project for Georgia Tech ECE4180.
Based on the newer [MbedOS 6](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.16/introduction/index.html) platform, this project incorporates networking, API calls, and audio-visual effects for an web-enabled alarm clock / weather prediction station.

## Hardware

The hardware used in this project is based on the hardware provided by the Georgia Tech ECE department.

Primary components used are:

- [mBed LPC1768](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/)
- [4D Systems uLCD-144-G2](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11377)
- [HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569)
- [Adafruit ESP8266 Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2471)
- [SparkFun microSD Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/544)
- [SparkFun RJ45 Ethernet Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13021)
- [SparkFun TPA2005D1 Amp](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11044)

Schematics and a breakout PCB are designed in [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/), which is free and open-source.

The hardware setup is currently as bare-bones as possible to simplify manual wiring.
